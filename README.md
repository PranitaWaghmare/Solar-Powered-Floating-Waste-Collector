# Solar-Powered-Floating-Waste-Collector

### Project overview
The Solar Powered Floating Waste Collector is a boat-like machine designed to clean water bodies by removing floating waste. It uses solar energy for power and is controlled wirelessly. A net collects trash, helping to reduce pollution and improve water quality. It is eco-friendly, low-cost, and easy to operate.

### Motivation 
This project is conducted to help clean the environment, specifically swimming pools, rivers, ponds using renewable energy, the sun, as a more efficient power source. Floating waste collector is a robot that help in cleaning swimming pools, small pondsand rivers, etc Automation plays an important rolein mass production. In this venture we have manufactured the remote worked waterway cleaning machine.

### Aim 
The main aim of this floating waste collector project is to clean the waste that gets accumulated on the surface of the surface of waster bodies thus keeping the water clean hence decreasing pollution.

### Objectives
The proposed work has objectives:
  1. To clean surface of water bodies.
  2. To design a boat which will rotate 180 O at tis location directions.
  3. To use wireless technology for operation.
  4. To use renewable energy source for operation of boat.
