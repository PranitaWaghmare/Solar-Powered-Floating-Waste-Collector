# Solar-Powered-Floating-Waste-Collector

### Aim 
The main aim of this floating waste collector project is to clean the waste that gets accumulated on the surface of the surface of waster bodies thus keeping the water clean hence decreasing pollution.

### Motivation 
This project is conducted to help clean the environment, specifically swimming pools, rivers, ponds using renewable energy, the sun, as a more efficient power source. Floating waste collector is a robot that help in cleaning swimming pools, small pondsand rivers, etc Automation plays an important rolein mass production. In this venture we have manufactured the remote worked waterway cleaning machine.

### Objectives
